I have finally made the robot balance. I have found out what is important for controlling the rolling motion - integral, massive integral. I have scalled it upt to 160.40. That is 4 times higher than than the proportional. I have figured out also that it is important to have good sensor fusion. I found this lithuanian dude and his code and in there there was a formula for complementary filter. It said to scale down the complementary filter accelerometer ussage with scale up in refresh rate. IT worked very good. I have also switched to using straght power from a battery bank without any discharge protection or stabilisation. The Tb6612 also works fine with this and the L298N is not that good. It just seemed like things improved because that stiction values were way higher for it. I have learned to not apply offsets to my motor start, but this might not be that important as the motor strats spinning for me at 12 percent now, which is very immpresivve from the tb6612. Forgot to mention that the derivative is apparently not that important i keep it low
